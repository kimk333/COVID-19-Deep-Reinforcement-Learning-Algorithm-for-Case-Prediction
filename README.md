# COVID-19-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithm-for-Case-Prediction
This repository is a code adapted to account for general control implementations and how these would affect the rise and fall of infections using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The code is adapted from a DRL stock prediction tutorial, and data is provided by the state of California.
